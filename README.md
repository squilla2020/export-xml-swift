# export-xml-swift
I'm trying to create an application which is a simple form. The form would take the input information and export into an XML file which can be read by another system. 

The code below is what the returning system is expecting.

I want to create a form with a Name field. The name field should update in all of the places in bold below. 

There should also be a generate button, that will export the XML file onto the users desktop, or somewhere on the machine.

I hope this makes sense and if anyone can help, that would be amazing. 

Thanks,
